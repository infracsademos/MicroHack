# Challenge 2 : Enable Virtual Machine Insights

Azure VM Insights is a service that provides performance and health monitoring for virtual machines (VMs) in Azure. It helps you identify and troubleshoot issues with your VMs by providing metrics, logs, and diagnostics data.

VM insights supports Windows and Linux operating systems on:

- Azure virtual machines.
- Azure virtual machine scale sets.
- Hybrid virtual machines connected with Azure Arc.
- On-premises virtual machines.
- Virtual machines hosted in another cloud environment.

VM insights provides a set of predefined workbooks that allow you to view trending of collected performance data over time. You can view this data in a single VM from the virtual machine directly, or you can use Azure Monitor to deliver an aggregated view of multiple VMs.

### Goal
After completing this challenge you should be able to enable VM Inisghts on you virtual machines.

### Task 1: Enable VM Insights for `vm-windows`

### Task 2: Enable VM Insights for `vm-linux`

### Task 3: Validate that configuration is correct

Although it may take a few minutes to view data in VM Insights, we can check the configuration by looking at the data collection rule.
