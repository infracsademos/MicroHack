# Challenge 0 - Create Azure Log Analytics Workspace and explore the lab environment

Azure Log Analytics is a tool in the Azure portal that's used to edit and run log queries against data in the Azure Monitor Logs store. You might write a simple query that returns a set of records and then use features of Log Analytics to sort, filter, and analyze them¹. It is used for collecting and analyzing log data, monitoring availability via web tests, exporting platform logs data from Azure resources, collecting metrics, alerts, and notifications³.
